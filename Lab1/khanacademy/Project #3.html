        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Make the Dough:
<ol>
<li>Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir, then let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy. This means the yeast is active.</li>
<li>Mix the dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
<li>Combine wet and dry: Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir with a spoon until a dough starts to form.</li>
<li>Knead the dough: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour. If it's too dry, add a small amount of water.</li>
<li>Let it rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise for 1-2 hours in a warm place, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Step 2: Make the Pizza Sauce</p>  
<ol>
    <li>In a saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic (if using) and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and sugar (if desired). Stir well and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 3: Assemble the Pizza:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 250°C (475°F). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>
    <li>Shape the dough: Punch down the risen dough to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half if you're making two pizzas, or leave it whole for a larger pizza. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness (thin crust or thick crust, depending on your preference). If the dough is too elastic and keeps shrinking, let it rest for 5-10 minutes and then continue rolling.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough: If using a pizza stone, transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper or a pizza peel. If using a baking sheet, lightly grease the sheet and transfer the dough onto it.</li>
    <li>Top your pizza: Spread a thin layer of the homemade pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Add the mozzarella cheese and your chosen toppings (pepperoni, vegetables, olives, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 4: Bake the Pizza:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and browned. If you're using a pizza stone, it may cook faster, so keep an eye on it.</li>
    <li>Check the crust: If you like a crispy crust, you can also use a pizza stone to get a nice crispy bottom, or bake it directly on the oven rack for the last few minutes to crisp up the base.</li>
    <li>Once baked, remove from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 5: Serve:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Slice your pizza into wedges and serve immediately. You can garnish with fresh basil, a drizzle of olive oil, or some parmesan cheese for extra flavor.</li>

<p> Step 1:Make the Sushi Rice</p>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse the rice: Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and helps the rice cook properly.</li>
    <li>Cook the rice: In a rice cooker, add the rinsed rice and 2 1/2 cups water. If you don't have a rice cooker, cook it on the stove in a pot with a tight-fitting lid. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 12-15 minutes. Let it sit for 10 minutes off the heat (still covered).</li>
    <li>Season the rice: While the rice is cooking, mix together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Heat this mixture gently in the microwave or on the stovetop until the sugar and salt dissolve. Don't boil it, just warm it.</li>
    <li>Cool the rice: Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a wide bowl or hangiri (a wooden bowl). Gently fold in the seasoned vinegar mixture using a wooden spoon or paddle. Let the rice cool to room temperature. You can use a fan or a paper towel to speed up the cooling process, but don't stir too aggressively.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 2: Prepare the Fillings</p>
<ol>
<li>Slice the fish: Slice your fish into long strips about 1/4-inch thick (make sure the fish is sushi-grade and fresh).</li>
<li>Prepare the vegetables: Cut your vegetables into long, thin strips. Common fillings include avocado, cucumber, and carrots. You can also use crab sticks or cooked shrimp if you prefer cooked fillings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 3: Set Up Your Rolling Station</p>
<ol>
    <li>Place a bamboo sushi mat on a clean surface (like a countertop or cutting board).
</li>
<li>Lay a sheet of nori (shiny side down) on the mat. If the nori has a rough side, that should be facing up to help the rice stick better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 4: Assemble the Sushi Roll</p>
<ol>
    <li>Wet your fingers with water to prevent the rice from sticking to them.</li>
    <li>Take about 1/2 cup of sushi rice and spread it evenly over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Press the rice down gently, but don’t squash it. Make sure to spread the rice evenly across the whole sheet.</li>
    <li>Lay your fillings (fish, avocado, cucumber, etc.) in a line across the middle of the rice. Don’t overfill—about 2-3 pieces of fish or veggies should be enough.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 5: Roll the Sushi:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Starting from the edge closest to you, lift the bamboo mat and roll the sushi tightly over the filling. Use your fingers to keep the fillings in place as you roll, but don’t roll too tightly or the sushi will become squished.</li>
    <li>As you roll, make sure to pull the mat gently to ensure a tight, uniform roll. When you reach the top edge (the border with no rice), wet it with a little water to seal the roll.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 6:Cut the Sushi</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use a sharp knife to slice the roll into 6-8 pieces. To get clean slices, wipe the knife with a wet towel between cuts.</li>
    <li>If you're making inside-out rolls (uramaki) (where the rice is on the outside), you can spread a little bit of sesame seeds or fish roe on the rice before rolling it. For this, you'll need to flip the nori over before adding the rice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 7:Serve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Serve the sushi rolls with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side.</li>
<li>Enjoy your homemade sushi with a cold beverage like green tea, sake, or beer!</li>

<p>Step 1: Make the Dough:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
    <li>Create a well in the center and crack the egg into it.</li>
    <li>Gradually add water (a little at a time) and mix the dough together until it forms a soft, smooth ball. If the dough is too dry, add a little more water; if too sticky, add a bit more flour.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 2:Prepare the Filling:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the onion: In a pan, heat 1-2 tbsp olive oil or butter. Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until softened and translucent (about 5-7 minutes).</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ground meat (beef or lamb), cooked onions, pepper, cumin (optional), and salt. Mix well until the ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
    <li>If the mixture feels too dry, you can add a bit of olive oil to keep it moist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 3:Roll Out the Dough:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Once the dough has rested, divide it into 2-3 portions. Roll out one portion on a floured surface, as thin as possible—ideally, about 1/16-inch thick.
</li>
<li>Using a sharp knife or a cookie cutter, cut the dough into small squares, about 2x2 inches each. The size can vary, but smaller squares (around 1.5 inches) are more traditional for Manti.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 4:Form the Manti:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Place about 1 tsp of filling in the center of each dough square.</li>
    <li>To shape the dumplings, bring two opposite corners of the square together and pinch them to form a little "pocket" with a point at the top. You can also fold the square into a triangle shape, depending on your preferred style.</li>
    <li>Press the edges firmly to seal them. Repeat this process until all the dough and filling are used.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 5: Cook the Manti:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Boil the manti: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently drop the manti into the water in batches (don’t overcrowd them). Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Boil for about 8-10 minutes, or until they float to the surface and are cooked through.</li>
    <li>Boil the manti: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently drop the manti into the water in batches (don’t overcrowd them). Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Boil for about 8-10 minutes, or until they float to the surface and are cooked through.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, use a slotted spoon to transfer the manti to a serving dish.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 6:Serve the Manti:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Place the cooked manti on a serving plate.</li>
    <li>Drizzle the spicy butter sauce over the top.</li>
    <li>Serve with a dollop of yogurt on the side, and sprinkle with dried or fresh mint for added flavor.</li>
