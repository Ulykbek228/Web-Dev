    <h2>Amazing facts about Liverpool</h2>

        <li>The Liverpool accent, known as Scouse, is one of the most distinctive in the UK. The term "Scouse" comes from lobscouse, a type of stew eaten by sailors, and it has become synonymous with the working-class identity of the city.</li>

It’s known for its historical buildings and stunning architecture, which includes landmarks like the Royal Liver Building, Cunard Building, and Port of Liverpool Building.</li>
        <li>Liverpool’s Albert Dock, opened in 1846, was the first structure in the world to be built using cast iron, brick, and stone. It revolutionized the shipping industry and was one of the first docks to be designed without the need for cranes or warehouses on the quayside. It’s now a UNESCO World Heritage site.</li>
        <li>The Royal Liver Building, completed in 1911, was the tallest building in the UK at the time. It also has two famous liver birds on top, which are said to watch over the city and protect it. The Liver birds are so iconic that they’re now considered the symbol of Liverpool.</li>
