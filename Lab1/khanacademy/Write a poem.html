        <h1>The Captive</h1>
        <p>A captive, alone in a dungeon I dwell,<br>
Entombed in the stillness and murk of a cell.<br>
Outside, in the courtyard, in wild, frenzied play,<br>
My comrade, an eagle, has pounced on his prey.<br>

Then, leaving the blood-spattered morsel, his eye,<br>
He fixes on me with a dolorous cry,<br>
A cry that is more like a call or a plea-<br>
"'Tis time," he is saying, "'tis time, let us flee!<br>

"We're both wed to freedom, so let us away<br>
To where lonely storm-clouds courageously stray,<br>
Where turbulent seas rush to merge with the sky,<br>
Where only the winds dare to venture and I!..."
